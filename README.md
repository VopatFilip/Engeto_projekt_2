Bulls and Cows Game

Description

The Bulls and Cows Game is a Python project designed to provide a fun and challenging guessing game experience. 
In this game, players are tasked with guessing a secret 4-digit number, and the program provides feedback on their guesses. 
The project ensures that players follow specific rules for their guesses and offers a rating based on their performance.


Prerequisites

To run this project, you need the following:

• Python 3.x installed on your system.
• Basic knowledge of using the command line or a code editor.


Features

• Secret Number Generation: A unique 4-digit secret number is generated for each game, ensuring a fresh and challenging experience.
• Input Validation: The program validates user input to ensure it adheres to the game's rules. It checks for a 4-digit number, unique digits, and no leading zeros.
• Guess Evaluation: After each guess, the program evaluates and provides feedback in terms of "bulls" (correct digit and correct position) and "cows" (correct digit but wrong position).
• Rating System: Upon successfully guessing the secret number, the game provides a rating based on the number of attempts made. Ratings include "amazing," "good," "average," and "not so good."
